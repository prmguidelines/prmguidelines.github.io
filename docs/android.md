Regression is one of the foundational techniques in Machine Learning. As one of the most well-understood algorithms, linear regression plays a vital role in solving real-life problems.
In this project, we wish to use Linear Regression to predict the scores of EPL soccer players.
With the business implications cleared. Let's get into the project's technical details.



This project is part of the Linear Regression Beginner Project Series, and it consists of discussing and implementing the fundamentals of Linear Regression in Python on the EPL Soccer Player Dataset.

## **Approach**

* Install Packages
* Import Libraries
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Correlation
* Relationship between Cost and Score
* Train - Test Split
* Linear Regression
* Model Summary
* Prediction on Test Data
* Diagnostics and Remedies

## **Important Libraries**
 
* **pandas**: pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use open-source data analysis and manipulation tool built on top of the Python programming language. Refer to [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for more information.
 
* **NumPy**: The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. Fast and versatile, the NumPy vectorization, indexing, and broadcasting concepts are the de-facto standards of array computing today. NumPy offers comprehensive mathematical functions, random number generators, linear algebra routines, Fourier transforms, and more. Refer to [documentation](https://numpy.org/) for more information. pandas and NumPy are together used for most of the data analysis and manipulation in Python.
 
* **Matplotlib**: Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Refer to [documentation](https://matplotlib.org/) for more information.
 
* **seaborn**: Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. Refer to [documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) for more information.
 
* **scikit-learn**: Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis
accessible to everybody and reusable in various contexts.
It is built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib to support machine learning in Python. Refer to [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) for more information.
 
* **statsmodels**: statsmodels is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests and statistical data exploration. Refer to [documentation](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) for more information.
 
* **SciPy**: SciPy provides algorithms for optimization, integration, interpolation, eigenvalue problems, algebraic equations, differential equations, statistics, and many other classes of problems. Refer to [documentation](https://scipy.org/) for more information.
